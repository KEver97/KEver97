ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Everett.
I am a student learning to code.
Here are some fun facts about me:
1. The first time I really did a coding project, it was for a technology competition!
2. Python was the first coding language I used.
3. I still do technology competitions now.
4. My first project from what I remember was a number guessing game. I think it went on to be a calculator.
I hope you have a nice day!
